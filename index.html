<h1>System involving video cameras and signals to batters revealed!</h1>
<p>In a stunning revelation, former Houston Astros pitcher Mike Friers, now a member of the Oakland Athletics, shared with journalists the damning accusation that the 2017 World Series Champion Houston Astros cheated their way to the franchise's first title. The system allegedly utilized hidden cameras in the outfield and a signal to the batter alerting them of the coming pitch type. Initially the signal involved banging on a trash can in the hallway connecting the dugout to the clubhouse, but rumors abound insinuating a more sophisticated system evolved over what might be several years of Astros malfeasance.</p>

<h2>UPDATE: HOUSTON ASTROS DEFINTIELY CHEATED AND TITLE LEGITIMACY CALLED INTO QUESTION</h2>
<p>After copping to the accusations of cheating during the league's investigation, the Houston Astros have acknowledged their complicity in the cheating scandal. Details on league's actions to follow.</p>
<h3>UPDATE: Astros players left off the hook, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred shows that he still sucks</h3>

<p>In exchange for total immunity, the Astros players came clean during the league's investigation, detailing their actions that have tainted an entire season of professional baseball. Unfortunately, the details of their testimonies may never be known as MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred has sealed their testimonies and has no intention of releasing the details to the public. Houston General Manager Jeff Luhnow and Manager A.J. Hinch have been suspended by the league for a paltry one year. MLB fans around the world are in an uproar for the token measures taken to punish those responsible for creating the greatest stain on the integrity of the game since the Black Sox scandal of 1919. Rob Manfred is no Kennesaw Mountain Landis, the league's first commissioner who banned for life the players implicated in the gambling scandal that involved throwing that year's World Series.

<p>One thing is for sure, the 2020 season is going to be a long, hard walk of shame for Astros players when they play on the road as fans from around the league won't be so forgiving as Mr. Manfred.</p>

<h2>UPDATE: STUPID CORONAVIRUS SAVES ASTROS PLAYERS FROM DESERVED HECKLING AND DERISION</h2>

<p>In one of the most damning turn of events in the wild year that has so far been 2020, MLB has decided to press on with a condensed 60 game regular season and expanded playoff format WITH NO FANS allowed in the ball parks.</p>
<p>Astros players are probably the most relieved team in the league with this plan in place as fans around MLB (including this author), were really, really, really looking forward to the opportunity to let the Astros players know what they think of them.</p>

<h1> TAMPA BAY RAYS DEFEAT ASTROS IN 7 GAMES OF AMERICAN LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES BECOMING AMERICA'S MOST BELOVED BALL TEAM!!!</h1>

<p>The much maligned Houston Astros climbed back from a 3 games to none deficit in the ALCS to lose in the deciding game, proving to all that they don't belong in another World Series mathcup. I suppose it is a lot harder to hit the ball when you don't know the pitch type that's coming, eh Asstros?</p>
